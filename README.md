## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge that I have done.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools that I like that could help me complete this challenge.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
